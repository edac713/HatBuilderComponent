## Files Overview:

### 1. `drop-down.html`
- **Role**: Provides the HTML structure for the Hat Builder component.
- **Key Elements**: Toggle buttons for patches and hats, drop-down menus containing collection cards.

### 2. `hat-builder.css`
- **Role**: Styles the Hat Builder component.
- **Key Elements**: CSS classes and variables that define the look and feel of the component.

### 3. `hat-builder-new.js`
- **Role**: Adds interactivity to the Hat Builder component.
- **Key Elements**: Functions and variables that manage the active state, show/hide carousels, and update headers.

## Interaction:

### 1. HTML & CSS
- `drop-down.html` uses classes from `hat-builder.css` to style its elements.

### 2. HTML & JS
- `hat-builder-new.js` manipulates the DOM elements defined in `drop-down.html` to add interactivity.

### 3. CSS & JS
- `hat-builder-new.js` toggles CSS classes defined in `hat-builder.css` to change element states.

## Real-Time Workflow with New Code:

### 1. Page Load
- `drop-down.html` loads and is styled by `hat-builder.css`.
- `hat-builder-new.js` initializes variables and sets up event listeners.

### 2. User Interaction
- User clicks on a toggle button (either patches or hats).

### 3. JS Execution
- `handleDropDownToggleClick` function is triggered.
- The corresponding drop-down (patches or hats) is displayed.

### 4. User Selects Collection
- User clicks on a collection card within the drop-down.

### 5. JS Execution
- `handleDropDownCollectionClick` function is triggered.
- Calls the existing `handleCollectionClick` function to update the carousel and header.
- Closes the drop-down.

### 6. UI Update
- The carousel and header are updated based on the selected collection.

### 7. User Continues
- User can continue to interact with the Hat Builder, and steps 2-6 are repeated as needed.
