# Overview of the Hat Builder Component

How It Works

```markdown
# 1. HTML Structure (hat-builder.html)

- The HTML file serves as the skeleton. It lays out the main sections like the "Get Started" button, carousels for patches and hats, and the toggle section.
- It also includes external libraries like jQuery and Slick Carousel for added functionalities.

# 2. Styling (hat-builder.css)

- The CSS file adds the visual elements. It styles the carousels, buttons, and headers.
- It uses CSS variables for easier management of common values like background color and z-index.

# 3. JavaScript Logic (hat-builder.js)

- The JS file brings the component to life. It initializes the carousels and sets their properties.
- It handles user interactions like play/pause and toggling between patches and hats.
- It also updates the UI based on these interactions, like changing the header label to indicate the active carousel.

# Workflow

1. User Interaction: The user clicks the "Get Started" button.
2. JavaScript Activation: The page scrolls to the hat builder container.
3. Carousel Initialization: Both the patch and hat carousels are initialized.
4. User Choices: The user can toggle between viewing patches and hats.
5. UI Updates: The header label and the active carousel update based on the user's choice.
6. Play/Pause: The user can also play or pause the carousel.

# Cohesion

- All three languages work in harmony:
  - HTML provides the structure.
  - CSS adds the style.
  - JavaScript adds interactivity and logic.

This cohesive component allows users to interact with a visually appealing and functional hat builder, aligning well with Gear Head Hats' focus on user-friendly designs and functionalities.
